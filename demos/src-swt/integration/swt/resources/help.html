Description

This demo shows how to integrate yFiles for JavaFX in a Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) application.

- A toolbar that provides SWT buttons for undo/redo functionality and to change the zoom level of the GraphControl which is a JavaFX Control.
- A right click on a node shown in the GraphControl opens a SWT context menu and allows the user to delete the clicked node from the GraphControl.
- On the left side a SWT palette offers nodes with different styles that can be dragged into the GraphControl.

Things to try

- Change the zoom level by clicking on buttons in the toolbar.
- Right click on a node to show a SWT context menu.
- Drag a node from the palette and drop it on the GraphControl.
