# SVG Image Export
  

 With the use of the [JFXConverter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfxconverter/) and [Batik SVG Toolkit](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) yFiles for JavaFX provides capabilities to export a graph in the SVG format. Furthermore, it is able to draw arbitrary objects onto the `GraphControl` and interact with them via `InputModes` . 

 The demo's ANT build file automatically downloads a suitable version of the JFXConverter library and its dependencies.
