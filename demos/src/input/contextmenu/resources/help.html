  This demo shows how to add a context menu to nodes and to the canvas background.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Right click on one of the nodes to open the node context menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select multiple nodes and right click on one of them to apply the context actions to all selected nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Right click an empty spot on the canvas to open a different context menu.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that in this demo, a node gets selected by right clicking on it. This isn't default behaviour but
  implemented explicitly in the event handler.
