<p>
  Enable orthogonal edge editing using the <code>GraphEditorInputMode</code>. Customize
  the behavior by implementing the <code>IOrthogonalEdgeHelper</code> interface and modifying the lookup of
  the edges in the graph via the <code>GraphDecorator</code> mechanism.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

Drag segments and bends of the edges and observe the different characteristics.

<h2>Edge Types</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#B22222"><b>Red edges</b></font> behave like normal edges with no orthogonal editing. The segments are
    straight lines with arbitrary slope. Dragging an unselected segment always creates a new bend.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="green"><b>Green edges</b></font> demonstrate the default orthogonal edge editing behavior. While
    dragging,
    all segments stay orthogonal and new bends are created as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="purple"><b>Purple edges</b></font> behave just like green edges except that the locations of the source
    port and target port are constraint to the given port candidates of the nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="orange"><b>Orange edges</b></font> behave just like green edges except that the source and
    target port can be placed at any location inside the node since they use dynamic port candidates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#4169E1"><b>Blue edges</b></font> behave just like green edges for the inner segments. The first and
    the last segment can have an arbitrary slope. If a new bend is added to one of these two segments, the newly
    created inner segment becomes orthogonal immediately.
  </li>
</ul>
