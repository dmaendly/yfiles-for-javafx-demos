# Edge Bundling
  

 This demo shows how edge bundling can be applied for reducing visual cluttering in dense graphs.   

 The edge curves are drawn using piecewise cubic bezier curves with gradient colors from dark-blue (that starts from the source node) to light-blue (that leads to the target node of the edge). For the approximation of the edge curves, a [CurveFittingLayoutStage](https://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjavafx/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.layout.CurveFittingLayoutStage) is applied.
