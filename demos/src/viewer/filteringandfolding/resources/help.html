<p>This demo shows how to configure
  <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjavafx/doc/api/#/dguide/filtering">filtering</a> and
  <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjavafx/doc/api/#/dguide/folding">folding</a>
  in the same application. While both features can be used in the same graph,
  the order of initialization is important.</p>

<p>Filtering and Folding are both features to reduce the complexity of a graph
  and to hide graph items from the viewer. With Folding, group nodes can be
  collapsed into folders, which hides their content. Filtering temporarily
  removes nodes or edges from the graph. Both features have their field of
  application, and sometimes the need arises to use both together.</p>

<h2>Things to Try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Select graph items and press the <em>Filter Items</em> button to filter those items from the graph.</li>

  <li>Press the <em>Reset Filter</em> button to un-hide any filtered items in the graph.</li>

  <li>Collapse (expand) group nodes by pressing their <em>-/+</em> button.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the sources for details.</p>
