<p>
  This demo shows how to style the built-in templates and UI elements of the yFiles for JavaFX library with CSS to match
  your color theme.
</p>
<p>
  Most visual elements like snaplines, indicators, handles, port and label candidates etc. have built-in style classes
  and can be styled out of the box with CSS.
</p>
<p>
  However, the included visualizations of the graph elements do not support
  CSS. Therefore, this demo offers extra styles with CSS support.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a new theme from the drop-down in the toolbar.</li>
  <li>Use the toolbar button <i>Show CSS</i> to open a text area showing the current CSS code.</li>
  <li>Change the CSS code and press the <i>Reload</i> button to apply the changes.</li>
</ul>
