# Graph Viewer
  

 The Graph Viewer demo application presents different graphs that are created with yFiles for JavaFX.   

 This demo shows graphs of various subjects with appropriate styles and arrangements. Despite of an overview of the whole graph, there are information texts that are bound to the whole graph or single nodes.
