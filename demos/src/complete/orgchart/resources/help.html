<h2>Organization Chart</h2>

<p>
  An organizational chart gives a clear picture of a company's staff and structure.
</p>

<p>
  This demo is a great example of how to use many yFiles features with little code to create a powerful application.
  Observe the benefits of level-of-detail rendering with visually rich node representations: from mere outlines of
  your data when looking at the entire diagram to all details when zooming in, this technique is easily realized
  with our library.
