# Table Editor
  

 The Table Editor demo application demonstrates out-of-the-box support for table nodes that model pools in business process diagrams, for example.   

 You may create and modify the table structure via drag'n'drop, easily re-arrange rows and columns by dragging their headers and resize them by dragging their borders. The automatic layout calculates a clear routing and placement of the table contents with just the press of a button.
